## Overview

This was a project built for a free lance web developer looking to start taking emails before going live.

## Technologies
Project Utilised: 
* ReactJS
* HTML
* CSS
* JS
* Adobe Photoshop

## Skills
* This project was started to help get some more experience with turning web design ideas into a working site. Throughout this project I found myself
becoming more and more confident, which I found quite motivating. 
* Once this project is complete, I will start to move away from focusing on web design and start focusing on functionality and the 
capabilities of React.
